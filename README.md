Created an application in R using R-Shiny and do text-based sentiment analysis of the IPL team's tweets and use it to check whether or not a sponsor should invest in the IPL team or not.

The problem is to make an application in R which does sentiment analysis using tweets from R following a menu-based approach to let the user choose to do text-based sentiment analysis or check the popularity of IPL teams or do a comparison of chances of winning of two IPL teams.

The application is used in R to do the following tasks:

Text-based sentiment analysis: To check whether the word entered has been used in a positive or negative sense in a tweet.
IPL team tweet analysis: To know whether the tweets of the IPL team are positive or negative and hence utilize this data to show advertisements to the user based on the situation of the team that he is following on twitter.
IPL team comparison: To compare the chances of winning of two teams and also as to know which team is better for investing money for advertisements and brand promotions as brands generally give advertisements to the winning team.
